# Current compatibility reports

## Two current Nexus reports — 2026-09-13

Source: <https://www.nexusmods.com/crimsondesert/mods/3374?tab=posts>.
All nine visible comments and their timestamps were checked; the two newest reports
are the current evidence.

At 05:04, WHOLE reported 2.1.10 on Steam build 25246367, RTX 4090 and NVIDIA
driver 616.92. Streamline DLSS/DLSS-RR 2.11.1 fails
`linkSwapchainToCmdQueue` and `CreateSwapChainForHwnd` with
`0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED)` immediately before a `0xC0000005` crash at
`CrimsonDesert.exe+0x3D0FEA6`.

At 08:49, jimos87 linked the DMM support package
<https://drive.proton.me/urls/V1AX5VHNV0#sIhaw6yiTPQJ>. Its game logs reproduce
the same Streamline error on an RTX 4080 SUPER with driver 616.92 and show that
the failure is intermittent. The dump has the same exception offset and proves
that the loaded Telemetry module is the exact public 2.1.10 ASI (timestamp
`0x6AA59B26`, image size `0x17C000`). Steam's overlay DLL, Streamline,
DesertLinkCore and MasterLooter were also loaded. This evidence supersedes the
earlier unverified stale-package theory for these crashes.

The owner also uses driver 616.92 on an RTX 3080. The owner later reproduced a
separate runtime swapchain-creation failure while changing the game's output/HDR
state for a newly connected second monitor; the two external systems still own the
Streamline startup reproduction. In jimos87's dump the
faulting game instruction dereferences `rcx == 0`; the crash thread retains
CrimsonDesert/Streamline/NVIDIA-driver frames and no Telemetry frame. The immediate
game exception is therefore the consequence of the missing graphics object after
the logged swapchain failure, while Telemetry remains the cause under investigation
for that earlier failure.

Disassembly of the exact matching game image identifies the missing object. The
routine beginning at RVA `0x3D0FE00` reads `[rbx+0xA8]` and calls vtable offset
`0x120`, method slot 36, `IDXGISwapChain3::GetCurrentBackBufferIndex`. The same
member is used earlier for vtable offset `0x50` with fullscreen arguments, matching
`IDXGISwapChain::SetFullscreenState`. The crash is therefore a direct null
dereference of the game's swapchain member after the Streamline failure. WHOLE
reproduced the failure in SDR, so HDR is not a supported cause.

Disassembly of the exact shipped `sl.dlss_g.dll` (SHA-256
`DAE3F24A690F3DEE3FBD89BDDE47FBEB6BF480CEE376ECFD0242A50E0BB6E6C6`) shows that
the `linkSwapchainToCmdQueue` error path logs the negative HRESULT returned directly
by its internal factory `CreateSwapChain`/`CreateSwapChainForHwnd` call. Together
with the official v2.11.1 factory ordering, this places the failure during DLFG's
post-create linking work, after the base swapchain return and before the Streamline
after-hook completes. That is exactly the interval 2.1.11 no longer modifies.

The first concrete unsafe ordering is in the overlay factory callback: it installed
five hooks on the just-created swapchain before NVIDIA Streamline's outer factory
wrapper had finished linking that chain to its command queue. Version 2.1.11
defers that tracking/hook step by 500 ms on the existing worker.
NVIDIA's official Streamline v2.11.1 tag confirms the call order: the base
`CreateSwapChainForHwnd` returns before Streamline runs its after-hooks and
`setupSwapchainProxy`. Telemetry 2.1.10 called `Track()` on that inner return path.
The first deferred candidate still held the returned chain in a pending COM pointer.
That is unsafe when Streamline or the game replaces a flip-model swapchain for the
same HWND: DXGI permits only one such chain per HWND, so Telemetry's extra reference
can make the replacement fail with E_ACCESSDENIED. The final 2.1.11 code releases
only its references for the same HWND before either factory-create call proceeds,
waiting for any submitted HUD GPU work first.

The owner's local runtime failure occurred at 16:17:07 after switching the game's
second-monitor/HDR output. Its game log contains CreateSwapChainForHwnd failed:
-2147024891 twice, then 0xC0000005 at CrimsonDesert.exe+0x3D05303. Its DMM support
bundle and 17,409,728-byte dump are preserved outside Git; dump SHA-256 is
290587A6193989B6AE8D8E23A4A7DF71BB7774498D3A9A59F3CF178310D2DF68.
That local rebuild routine differs from the external startup crash routine. Treat
the two live acceptance tests separately even though both exercise swapchain
lifetime. WHOLE's SDR reproduction still disproves HDR as a necessary cause.

Automated D3D12 tests now pass both an immediate nested replacement and a later
replacement after the HUD adopted a chain, in every SDR/scRGB UI mode. The public
2.1.10 release remains unchanged until 2.1.11 is uploaded. External multi-start
validation on an affected system is pending; do not state that the external crash
is fixed until it passes.

## Historical report relayed on 2026-09-12, posted around 08:30

A Nexus user reported two separate problems with the public **2.0.2 ASI package**.
The project owner supplied the post text and confirmed the download listing
`12 Sep 2026, 6:02AM ... version 2.0.2` (timezone not specified). Its direct link,
GPU/driver, other mods and crash details are not yet available. This is external
user evidence, not a reproduced local failure or proof of a particular D3D12
hook defect. It predates the new production per-light implementation.

1. DMM deployed `CrimsonDesertTelemetry.asi`, `CrimsonDesertTelemetry.Core.dll`
   and the INI, but omitted `crimson-desert-telemetry.dll` and both lowercase
   `.deps.cfg` / `.runtimeconfig.cfg` companions. Copying those three files from
   the same package removed the missing-host error and allowed host startup.
2. The game still crashed with graphics-related features enabled. The reported
   tests include `Lights=1`, `Overlay=1`, `Notifications=1`, SDR as well as HDR;
   setting only `Radar3D=0`, `ManyLights=0`, or console patch options off did not
   prevent it. The configuration with Lights, Overlay, Notifications and
   LightOverlay all disabled launched successfully. The reporter states the
   game build and .NET runtime are correct, but their actual values are unverified.

The successful server-only case narrows the affected enabled paths. It does not
identify the faulting module, hook, GPU interface or resource lifecycle, and a
single disabled option does not isolate other still-enabled features.

Required next evidence: exact package hash and DMM version, installed companion-file
hashes, full INI, GPU/driver and other graphics mods/overlays/frame generation,
the native/bootstrap logs and faulting module/exception offset. Reproduce one
feature combination at a time before changing graphics code. Do not claim that
the current occlusion update resolves this report.

Package validation proves ZIP contents and their equality with the staged
payload; it does not prove DMM deployment on every system. This machine has also
retained older `.deps.cfg` metadata on upgrades. Preserve useful INI preferences,
and verify all six runtime files after deployment. Keep historical packages and
their evidence intact. See [mod-manager validation](MOD_MANAGER_VALIDATION.md).

Read-only inspection of the preserved local v2.0.2 ZIP on 2026-09-12 confirms that
all three reportedly omitted companions are present under its expected package
root, alongside the other six files. The reporter's downloaded ZIP hash is not
available, so equality with that preserved archive is not yet proven.

## Local stability candidate control — later on2026-09-12

rc.1 OFF started successfully on the local RTX3080/SDR setup with all offered
feature switches enabled. Raw/smoothed/ambient streams remain available across
two30-second windows; user confirms F8–F10 and menu entry/exit without flicker or
crash. The debug console is excluded from this production package. This local
result is not evidence that the external2.0.2 crash has the same cause or is fixed.

All six runtime companions in DMM's library match rc.1. Deployed bin64 files match
except deps.cfg, which still has2.1.8 version labels but the identical dependency/
runtime asset structure. The new host runs using it. This proves a local metadata
replacement discrepancy after import, not missing binaries in the ZIP. See
[the release ledger](STABLE_RELEASE_VALIDATION.md) for exact evidence and limits.

User-confirmed DMM1.9.4 deletion removes ASI/INI/logs but leaves both DLLs and CFGs.
Reimport still leaves the old deps.cfg in bin64 despite all six current library
files. The user requires clean removal. An updated-DMM test is pending; no direct
file cleanup was performed to hide this deployment behavior.

The same behavior was reproduced after updating to DMM2.8.1: package removal left
both Telemetry DLLs and both CFG files, and reimport retained the older deps.cfg.
After the user manually removed those four owned leftovers with the game closed,
a clean DMM2.8.1 import deployed all six rc.1 files with exact matching hashes.

After an NVIDIA driver update to32.0.16.1692, the first game start rebuilt shaders
and native capture hit Windows error258 (WAIT_TIMEOUT) during the long initial
load. The owner then reproduced a new shader compilation with the mod disabled,
closed the game during compilation, activated the mod and restarted directly into
the game without another compilation. In this observed A/B sequence the compile
was initiated without Telemetry and activation did not initiate one. A second
modded start did not reproduce the capture failure. Release2.1.10 therefore waits for the
host's first valid player/render-camera `playing` state before arming light/sky
GPU capture and separates command-list submission timeout from GPU-fence timeout.
This local cause is distinct from the unresolved external2.0.2 crash report.

Windows Explorer/taskbar has also displayed “not responding” while the local game
continued normally. During the report, `IsHungAppWindow` was false and the process
reported `Responding=true`; no actual application hang was established.
