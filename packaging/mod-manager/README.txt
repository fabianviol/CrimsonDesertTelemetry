Crimson Desert Telemetry
========================
Live light contributions, player/render-camera telemetry and local ambient data,
with a corner HUD, 3D light radar, fullscreen markers and startup/error notices.
Local HTTP/WebSocket APIs support other tools. This mod does not drive lamps.

New in 2.2:
- Lights all around you. Telemetry reads the game's light list before the
  renderer discards what the current view cannot see, so lights behind the
  camera stay in the API, radar and markers. A fire bowl arrives as one light.
- Which lights actually reach you. The game's own physics casts nine rays from
  the camera to every nearby light. A wall blocks all nine; a lantern cage only
  some, so the lantern stays visible. The HUD dims blocked lights (F11 hides
  them) and the API reports clear/blocked/unknown per light. ON by default.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------
Windows x64, Microsoft .NET 8 ASP.NET Core Runtime (x64), one x64 ASI loader,
and Crimson Desert patch version 2.03.02 on Steam for Windows. Technical identity:
EXE file version 1.0.0.2976, Steam build ID 25477059. Native capture rejects
unknown EXEs. The file/Steam numbers are not the game's public patch version.
Close the game, back up useful INI preferences and disable previous telemetry
packages and any separate legacy console ASI, if installed.
Import and enable the complete ZIP in DMM. Keep your existing loader and other
mods. Verify ALL six runtime files beside the game EXE, from the SAME version:

CrimsonDesertTelemetry.asi
CrimsonDesertTelemetry.Core.dll
CrimsonDesertTelemetry.ini
crimson-desert-telemetry.dll
crimson-desert-telemetry.deps.cfg
crimson-desert-telemetry.runtimeconfig.cfg

Important DMM upgrade/removal note: local tests with DMM 2.8.1 showed that deleting
this package can leave both Telemetry DLLs and both lowercase CFG files behind,
and an upgrade can retain an older deps.cfg. With the game closed, remove the old
package in DMM, then verify and delete only these four leftover Telemetry files
before importing the new ZIP:

CrimsonDesertTelemetry.Core.dll
crimson-desert-telemetry.dll
crimson-desert-telemetry.deps.cfg
crimson-desert-telemetry.runtimeconfig.cfg

Do not delete your ASI loader. Back up a customized Telemetry INI before replacing
the package. A clean DMM 2.8.1 import was verified to deploy all six current files.

Keep .cfg names unchanged; some manager versions interpret loose JSON as patches.
The bootstrap caches only runtime configuration text under
LOCALAPPDATA/CrimsonDesertTelemetry/Runtime, keyed and verified by SHA-256.
No executable or game data is copied into that cache. Hot-unloading is unsupported.
Complete ZIP contents do not prove complete manager deployment. JSON Mod Manager
and manual ASI-loader installation need the same files; their current full
installation/uninstallation matrix remains pending.

Compatibility fix retained from 2.1.11: an overlay-owned DXGI reference could keep
an old flip-model swapchain alive while NVIDIA Streamline or the game replaced it
for the same window. That failure was observed as CreateSwapChainForHwnd
E_ACCESSDENIED. Automated nested/startup-style and runtime display/HDR replacement
tests pass. One of the two reporters confirmed the fix; the second has not
reported back. Include a DMM support bundle if a crash persists.

Controls and configuration
--------------------------
The supplied INI enables the supported telemetry, ambient, upstream-light,
light-visibility and HUD paths. F8: corner HUD/radar. F9: details.
F10: fullscreen light markers. F11: hide/show lights whose nine visibility rays
are all blocked (by default they are only dimmed); unknown lights stay shown.
Each shortcut accepts a decimal Windows virtual-key code; 0 disables that key.
Defaults: Overlay.ToggleKey=119, Overlay.DetailsKey=120,
LightOverlay.ToggleKey=121, LightOverlay.OcclusionToggleKey=122.
Keys do not stop API capture.
Automatic hiding in every menu is not implemented; use F8/F10 to hide the views.
INI changes require a game restart; display keys work immediately.

Research, Console, Explorer, the broad player/all-source bridge and OcclusionTest
remain absent from this production build. Merge preferences into the new template.

Lights.Enabled includes authored lights; ManyLights adds renderer contributions
at 20 Hz by default and Upstream=1 adds all current engine lights from the same
capture. Ambient and SourceVisibility require ManyLights. Server.SampleRateHz
defaults to 60;
faster API polling does not create additional GPU samples. NearbyRadius uses game
units. LightSmoothing controls grouping and EMA; raw values remain unchanged.
Radar3D=0 selects the compass. AutoScale/Scale/Opacity/Corner control layout.
LightOverlay.Radius (default 100) is shared by markers, radar and visibility rays;
more lights share the 256-target visibility budget. MaxMarkers/MaxLabels bound
visual clutter, not source discovery.
HdrPaperWhiteNits=200 sets shared HDR UI white, clamped to 80-500 nits.
Notifications show readiness briefly or persistent actionable errors. Readiness
requires valid player and render-camera data. Native light/sky capture waits for
that first playable-world signal, so initial menu/shader loading cannot consume a
GPU transaction. Consult logs if graphics initialization fails.
Set Enabled=0 in Overlay, LightOverlay AND Notifications to disable all UI owners
and UI hooks/client. InitiallyVisible=0 only hides an enabled view. Server and
native light capture are independently configured.

API and data limits
-------------------
HTTP:      http://127.0.0.1:27311/v1/snapshot
Health:    http://127.0.0.1:27311/v1/health
Schema:    http://127.0.0.1:27311/v1/schema
WebSocket: ws://127.0.0.1:27311/v1/stream
Ambient:   http://127.0.0.1:27311/v1/ambient
Smoothed:  http://127.0.0.1:27311/v1/lights/smoothed

The host listens on loopback only. Do not launch another host on its port.
Routes remain v1; light-enabled snapshots use additive schema 1.6, otherwise 1.1.
lights.upstream lists every current engine light of a capture, including behind
the camera; rendererSelected marks those the renderer also used in this view.
Upstream and rendered lights carry sourceVisibility clear/blocked/unknown with
method physics-ray-fan, ray counts and measurement age (expires after 500 ms).
Unknown/stale lights remain present with null attenuation; nothing is removed.
Authored/rendered/upstream arrays overlap; do not add them together. It is not a
persistent light registry; a missing source does not prove OFF.
Linear HDR RGB/luminance are renderer values, not lumens or final pixels.
Ambient contains global sky, camera-local sky exposure and their derived estimate.
Exposure is sampled at the camera location, not the fraction of sky on screen.
An earlier package passed open/enclosed/open; this build's acceptance check is
separate. It is not measured room brightness. Camera-orientation sensitivity
remains under investigation. Root orientation is not body pose; display spot-arrow
and frustum lengths are schematic. Fast motion can expose projection latency.

Graphics and compatibility
--------------------------
Automated D3D12 tests cover SDR/HDR10/scRGB and all UI owners together.
Live HDR-display, frame-generation and AMD/Intel game acceptance remain pending.
No NVIDIA, DLSS, Streamline, Nsight or PIX runtime dependency is required.
Unknown output format/color-space combinations are unsupported. HDR UI uses two
extra full-resolution textures and a scene composite; SDR has no extra composite.
Software-GPU tests do not establish compatibility with every game setup.

Diagnostics
-----------
The host reads memory; the plugin uses guarded code/D3D12 hooks and GPU copies.
No gameplay-control API or anti-cheat bypass is provided.
Logs beside the plugin: CrimsonDesertTelemetry.bootstrap.log (startup/host),
CrimsonDesertTelemetry.host.log, CrimsonDesertTelemetry.overlay.log (UI),
CrimsonDesertTelemetry.native.log (light/ambient capture).
Exact ASI/ZIP scan and live results belong to the versioned validation record;
an earlier clean scan is not a verdict for this binary.

Light visibility limits
-----------------------
Visibility is a sampled collision estimate, not how much light gets through.
Nine rays go from the camera to fixed points around each light: any free ray
counts as clear. Thin gaps can make a light behind a fence or cage clear, and
geometry without collision (foliage, some decorations) does not block. It runs
only on the exact supported game build; otherwise every light stays unknown.
SourceVisibility.Enabled=0 switches it off. The normal light, smoothed-light and
ambient streams do not depend on this setting.
The complete source and preserved research are on GitHub. Forks are welcome.
