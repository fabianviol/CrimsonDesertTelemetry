# Current checkpoint — per-light direct visibility, 2026-09-12

## Active priority

Focus only on this question for each local light already known to the project:

```text
Does solid world geometry block the direct segment from the player to this source?
```

Camera direction, on-screen state, Ambient, image brightness and bounced light are
outside this test. Fire, torch, candle, lamp, point and spot sources use the same
geometry rule. Stable release 2.1.10 and its hotfix/packaging work are complete;
do not reopen them unless they directly block this task. Do not work on CrimsonHue.

The production goal still requires both Ambient Occlusion and per-light Source
Occlusion in `CDT_RESEARCH=OFF`. Ambient already passed its controlled
open -> enclosed -> open test. Per-light visibility is not complete until research
and production each pass controlled live visible -> blocked -> visible tests,
including a retained source behind or outside the camera view.

## Current implementation

The previous camera-origin, renderer-only zero-crossing trace was rejected for two
measured reasons: it did not cover all known sources or the requested player
receiver, and filtered t233 wall samples can remain slightly positive.

The new research candidate consists of:

- `SourceVisibilityClient`: publishes player position + `(0,1,0)` and the spatially
  deduplicated union of authored and rendered light positions;
- `source_visibility_bridge`: a separate seqlocked native query/result mapping;
- `sdf_visibility`: quarter-cell segment sampling, near-surface threshold
  `0.5 * cellSize`, and blocked after one complete cell of connected samples;
- schema 1.5 metadata on both authored and rendered records, position-matched back
  without changing positions, RGB, raw records or smoothed contributions.

No camera direction or projection exists in the new bridge. The native worker
traces every new query against one immutable SDF volume. Unknown/stale results do
not hide or attenuate API records. The old render-capture visibility writer is
explicitly disabled while this research bridge is active.

The bridge is bounded to the nearest 256 distinct source positions, merges within
0.1 game unit, rejects a response after the player receiver moved more than
0.75 game unit, and expires results after 1500 ms. Sources absent from both input
feeds cannot be classified and must never be called blocked.

Implementation and API details: [SOURCE_VISIBILITY.md](SOURCE_VISIBILITY.md).
Preserved live failures/captures: [SOURCE_VISIBILITY_REGRESSION.md](SOURCE_VISIBILITY_REGRESSION.md).

## Evidence before live test

The exact native classifier reproduces all 17 preserved labelled controls:

- room: two blocked and two clear sources;
- same room source: three fresh clear-pose captures;
- Serkis: clear -> blocked -> clear;
- Warspike: two clear -> three blocked -> two clear.

This is offline replay of real retained volumes, not live acceptance. Relevant
automated checks pass:

- complete managed test executable, including the schema 1.5 player/query bridge;
- native SDF clear/blocked/freshness/context controls;
- native direction-independent query/result bridge;
- 384 WARP/debug-layer readback controls;
- research ASI compile and expanded/ZIP package validation.

The JSON schema parses successfully. `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are byte-identical.

## Exact package for the next tester

Use only:

`artifacts/mod-manager/CrimsonDesertTelemetry-v2.1.11-source-visibility.2-ModManagers.zip`

This is a private `CDT_RESEARCH=ON` package for Steam build 25246367, not a public
release. It contains its own research README and a ready test INI:

- `SourceVisibility.Enabled=1`
- `Overlay.ShowDetails=1`
- `LightOverlay.HideOccluded=0` so wrong verdicts remain visible
- `Research.SignedDistanceReadbackIntervalMs=1000`
- up to 120 automatically started SDF transactions

Exact artifacts:

| File | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `CrimsonDesertTelemetry.asi` | 1,591,296 | `0F017D5766556B8CB4DC7E89990032A86CE19AC20902AABF7ABBCE8A4DFD8CE5` |
| test ZIP | 943,190 | `2AEEA9DE5647F0C2C5F3EA5DAA5078C3A4ED546B6D97200B764B2EC95DAFB22F` |

Local Microsoft Defender custom scans passed both exact files with no threats.
Completed VirusTotal results for these exact research artifacts are **ASI 11/71**
and **ZIP 7/68** (60 undetected and one analysis failure for the ZIP). This is a
significant regression from the stable production build and blocks using this
architecture as a release candidate. It does not invalidate a private functional
test, but it must not be published or promoted to `CDT_RESEARCH=OFF` unchanged.
Investigate it later as a product/build regression without obfuscation or signature
gaming. The earlier `.1` artifact is superseded and must not be tested.

## One next step

With the game closed, install the `.2` ZIP cleanly through DMM. In the known room,
hold one player position where two identified sources are physically clear and two
are behind solid wood. Keep F11 in show-blocked mode. Verify that all four records
receive the correct status. Rotate the camera without moving the player and verify
retained verdicts do not change. Then perform visible -> blocked -> visible on one
identified fire/candle/lamp.

If the live result fails, capture the exact source positions, player position,
verdicts, `closestApproach`, `volumeSequence`, `contextFrame` and ages before tuning
anything. If it passes across relevant source types and behind-camera coverage,
move only the minimal bridge/classifier/acquisition pieces into `CDT_RESEARCH=OFF`
and repeat the same production test.

## Worktree care

Do not stage the unrelated root-level capture/VT helper scripts, JSON outputs or
scratch C++ files already present as untracked evidence. Do not delete prior
artifacts. Commit only the explicit implementation, tests, package tooling and
documentation for this candidate.
